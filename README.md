# About me

I am an Oregon based engineering leader who has a long standing obsession with learning and problem solving. I'm most happy when I'm able to work collaboratively with a diverse team, applying our collective experience and problem solving strategies to address real customer and business challenges. I maintain a broad view of the software development landscape and lean towards being a generalist, with a deep product oriented focus and many years of experience building successful platforms.

I was most recently Engineering Group Lead for the Developer Product Group (DPG). Our scope was the platform and capabilities that enabled external developers to build and extend HubSpot. This was a very wide space, including everything from our external documentation to serverless infrastructure and observability. Our most recent success was adding powerful UI extensibility that allowed developers to build custom UIs within the HubSpot product. I managed over 45 engineers, including 4 staff engineers, 2 managers, and 9 tech leads.

Through June of 2021, I was employed at Nike as an engineering leader within the Marketing Technology org, leading a number of teams focused on building out the Nike Communications Platform. This platform was designed to power all digital marketing communications (with an intent to extend into transactional communication, as well). Prior to that, I was responsible for leading the development of the Nike Activity Platform. If you've used the Nike Run Club or Nike Training Club apps, the systems managing that data were built by the teams led.

I was also the host of the Nike Tech Talks, a highly successful series of events showcasing world class subject matter experts from across the industry, an internal evangelist for and organizer of our open-source program, and an advocate for building strong and healthy engineering cultures.

At various times throughout my career I have been:
 * a leader, software architect, and engineer
 * the founder and organizer of the PNWScala conference
 * a conference speaker
 * a user group founder & organizer
 * a presenter at a variety of user groups, meetups, and corporate events
 * technical book proofreader and reviewer

I have more books than I know what to do with and not enough time to read them all. [Which is how it should be](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/). I adore dogs, especially my own, and I love watching movies and binging on great TV shows with my wife.
